## 1. Game Design Sketch

### Core Gameplay Loop

The game follows a turn-based structure with real-time updates:

1.  **Game Creation/Joining:** Players can initiate a new game session or join an existing one.
2.  **Player Turn:**
    * The current player places tiles on the board to form a word.
    * The player submits their proposed word.
    * **Word Validation:** The submitted word is checked against a server-side dictionary.
    * **Scoring:** If valid, the word is scored based on tile values and board bonuses.
    * **Tile Drawing:** The player draws new tiles from the bag to replenish their hand.
    * **Turn End:** The turn automatically passes to the next player.
3.  **Game End:** The game concludes when the tile bag is empty and one player has used all their tiles, or if all players consecutively pass their turn.
4.  **Winner Determination:** The player with the highest score at the game's conclusion is declared the winner.

### Game State Elements

The core data points that define the current state of a game include:

* **Board:** A 15x15 grid, storing the positions and letters of all placed tiles, including special squares (e.g., double letter score, triple word score).
* **Tile Bag:** A dynamic collection of all remaining available tiles (letters and blank tiles), along with their quantities and point values.
* **Player Hands:** Each player's current set of tiles held privately.
* **Player Scores:** The cumulative score for each participant.
* **Turn Tracker:** An indicator of which player's turn it currently is.
* **Game ID:** A unique identifier for each distinct game session.
* **Game Status:** A flag indicating the current phase of the game (e.g., "Lobby", "In Progress", "Finished").
* **Chat History:** A log of messages exchanged between players during the game.

### Key Features

* **Multiplayer:** Supports up to 4 players per game session.
* **Real-time Updates:** Ensures immediate synchronisation of board state, scores, and chat across all connected clients.
* **Word Validation:** Server-side dictionary lookup to prevent cheating and ensure valid words.
* **Scoring Logic:** Accurate calculation of scores, incorporating tile values and board bonuses.
* **Tile Management:** Comprehensive handling of tile drawing, exchanging, and tracking of available tiles.
* **User Authentication:** Basic user accounts for game persistence and identification.
* **Game Lobby:** A central area where players can view active games and join them.

## 2. Technical Architecture

### Frontend (Web)

* **Technology:** React with Tailwind CSS for styling. This choice provides a robust component-based structure, excellent responsiveness across devices, and a modern, efficient development experience.
* **Key Components:**
    * **Game Board:** Renders the 15x15 grid, displaying placed tiles and special squares.
    * **Player Hand:** Manages and displays the current player's tiles, supporting drag-and-drop functionality.
    * **Scoreboard:** Displays real-time scores for all players.
    * **Chat Interface:** Allows players to communicate during the game.
    * **Lobby/Game Creation Interface:** Enables users to create new games or join existing ones.
* **Interaction:** The frontend communicates with the backend primarily through the Firestore SDK for real-time data synchronisation and makes direct calls to Firebase Functions for specific game actions requiring server-side logic.

### Backend

* **Database:** Google Cloud Firestore.
    * **Rationale:** Firestore is a NoSQL, cloud-hosted database offering real-time synchronisation capabilities, making it an excellent choice for multiplayer games. Its flexible, document-based model is well-suited for storing dynamic game states.
    * **Data Structure:**
        * `games` collection: Each document in this collection represents a unique game session, identified by a `gameId`.
            * **Fields:** `boardState` (an array or map representing the board, including tile positions), `tileBag` (remaining tiles and their counts), `players` (an array of player objects, each containing `userId`, `hand`, `score`, and `order`), `currentPlayerId`, `status`, and `chatHistory`.
        * `users` collection: Stores user profiles, identified by `userId`, containing `username` and other user-specific data.
    * **Security Rules:** Essential for defining and enforcing granular read/write access to game data, based on user authentication status and participation in a specific game.
* **Authentication:** Firebase Authentication.
    * Handles user registration, login, and session management securely.
    * Integrates seamlessly with Firestore security rules to control data access.
* **Server-side Logic (Game Logic & Validation):** Firebase Functions.
    * **Rationale:** Serverless functions that automatically execute in response to events (e.g., HTTP requests from the frontend, writes to Firestore documents).
    * **Critical for:**
        * **Word Validation:** Performing authoritative dictionary lookups on the server to prevent client-side manipulation.
        * **Scoring:** Calculating scores accurately and consistently on the server.
        * **Game State Transitions:** Ensuring valid moves, managing turn progression, drawing tiles from the bag, and updating the game state atomically to maintain consistency.
        * **Matchmaking/Lobby Management:** Handling the creation and joining of game sessions.
        * **Security:** Enforcing core game rules that cannot be bypassed or tampered with on the client side.

## 4. Interfaces Between Subprojects

Defining clear interfaces is crucial for enabling parallel development and ensuring seamless integration.

### A. Frontend (React) to Backend (Firebase Functions)

* **Primary Interaction:** The Frontend will initiate HTTP requests to Firebase Functions for actions that require server-side validation, complex game logic, or atomic state changes.
* **Key Function Calls (Frontend initiated):**
    * `createGame(userId, gameName)`: Creates a new game instance.
    * `joinGame(gameId, userId)`: Adds a player to an existing game.
    * `submitWord(gameId, userId, wordPlacement, tilesUsed)`: Submits a word, triggering validation, scoring, and state updates.
    * `passTurn(gameId, userId)`: Allows the current player to pass their turn.
    * `exchangeTiles(gameId, userId, tilesToExchange)`: Exchanges specified tiles from the player's hand with new ones from the tile bag.
    * `sendMessage(gameId, userId, message)`: Sends a chat message to the game's chat history.
* **Data Structures for Requests:**
    * `wordPlacement`: An array of objects, each structured as `{ letter: 'A', row: 0, col: 0 }`, detailing the placed tiles.
    * `tilesUsed`: An array of strings representing the letters of tiles used from the player's hand.
    * `tilesToExchange`: An array of strings representing the letters of tiles to be exchanged.
* **Responses:** Firebase Functions will return a success/error status, potentially updated game state (though most real-time updates are handled by Firestore listeners), or specific error messages.

### B. Backend (Firebase Functions) to Firestore

* **Primary Interaction:** Firebase Functions will read from and write to Firestore documents to manage and persist the game state.
* **Key Firestore Operations (Functions initiated):**
    * `doc(db, 'games', gameId)`: Obtains a reference to a specific game document.
    * `updateDoc(gameRef, { ... })`: Updates specific fields within a game document (e.g., `boardState`, `playerScores`, `playerHands`, `currentPlayerId`).
    * `setDoc(gameRef, { ... })`: Creates a new game document.
    * `addDoc(collection(db, 'users'), { ... })`: Adds a new user profile document.
    * `getDoc(gameRef)`: Retrieves the current state of a game document for validation or processing.
    * `runTransaction(...)`: **Crucial for atomic updates** to game state (e.g., ensuring consistency between tile bag and player hand updates during a `submitWord` operation).
* **Data Structures in Firestore:**
    * `games/{gameId}`:
        ```json
        {
          "boardState": [ /* 15x15 array of objects { letter: 'A', value: 1, row: 0, col: 0 } or null */ ],
          "tileBag": { "A": 9, "B": 2, "C": 2, /* ... all letters and their counts */ },
          "players": [
            { "userId": "user123", "username": "Louise", "hand": ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G"], "score": 150, "order": 0 },
            { "userId": "user456", "username": "John", "hand": ["H", "I", "J", "K", "L", "M", "N"], "score": 120, "order": 1 }
            // ... up to 4 player objects
          ],
          "currentPlayerId": "user123",
          "status": "in_progress", // Can be "lobby", "in_progress", "finished"
          "chatHistory": [
            { "userId": "user123", "message": "Good luck everyone!", "timestamp": "2025-07-11T15:30:00Z" }
          ],
          "lastMoveTimestamp": "2025-07-11T15:30:00Z"
        }
        ```
    * `users/{userId}`:
        ```json
        {
          "username": "Louise",
          "email": "louise@example.com",
          "gamesPlayed": 5,
          "totalScore": 1200,
          "lastLogin": "2025-07-11T15:25:00Z"
        }
        ```

### C. Frontend (React) to Firestore (Real-time Listeners)

* **Primary Interaction:** The Frontend will subscribe to real-time updates from Firestore to immediately reflect changes in the game state without needing to poll the server.
* **Key Firestore Operations (Frontend initiated):**
    * `onSnapshot(doc(db, 'games', gameId), (docSnapshot) => { ... })`: Establishes a real-time listener for changes to the currently active game document.
    * `onSnapshot(collection(db, 'games'), (querySnapshot) => { ... })`: Establishes a real-time listener for changes to the list of available games in the lobby.
* **Data Flow:** When a Firebase Function updates a game document (e.g., after a `submitWord` call), Firestore automatically pushes these changes to all connected clients that are listening via `onSnapshot`. The React components on the frontend then automatically re-render to display the new data, ensuring a dynamic and responsive user interface.

## 5. Tools & Workflow

* **Google Canvas/Gemini CLI:** Leverage these tools for rapid prototyping, generating boilerplate code, and obtaining intelligent suggestions for specific components, functions, or architectural patterns. This will be invaluable for "vibe coding" and quick iterations.
* **Version Control:** Git (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
    * **Branching Strategy:** We will adopt a feature-branch workflow, where each task is developed on a dedicated branch, merged into a `develop` branch for integration testing, and then into `main` for releases.
* **Communication:** Regular communication is key. This includes:
    * Daily stand-up meetings to synchronise progress and address blockers.
    * Shared documentation (like this plan!) to ensure everyone is aligned.
    * A dedicated chat channel (e.g., Google Chat, Slack) for quick questions and updates.
* **Task Management:** A simple task board (e.g., Trello, Jira, Asana) will be used to track tasks, assignees, priorities, and overall project progress.

This structured approach is designed to enable your team of three to work efficiently and in parallel, with clear responsibilities and well-defined interfaces, making your "vibe coding" journey a productive and enjoyable one!

C. Frontend (React) to Firestore (Real-time Listeners)
Primary Interaction: The Frontend will subscribe to real-time updates from Firestore to immediately reflect changes in the game state without needing to poll the server.

Key Firestore Operations (Frontend initiated):

onSnapshot(doc(db, 'games', gameId), (docSnapshot) => { ... }): Establishes a real-time listener for changes to the currently active game document.

onSnapshot(collection(db, 'games'), (querySnapshot) => { ... }): Establishes a real-time listener for changes to the list of available games in the lobby.

Data Flow: When a Firebase Function updates a game document (e.g., after a submitWord call), Firestore automatically pushes these changes to all connected clients that are listening via onSnapshot. The React components on the frontend then automatically re-render to display the new data, ensuring a dynamic and responsive user interface.

5. Tools & Workflow
Google Canvas/Gemini CLI: Leverage these tools for rapid prototyping, generating boilerplate code, and obtaining intelligent suggestions for specific components, functions, or architectural patterns. This will be invaluable for "vibe coding" and quick iterations.

Version Control: Git (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).

Branching Strategy: We will adopt a feature-branch workflow, where each task is developed on a dedicated branch, merged into a develop branch for integration testing, and then into main for releases.

Communication: Regular communication is key. This includes:

Daily stand-up meetings to synchronise progress and address blockers.

Shared documentation (like this plan!) to ensure everyone is aligned.

A dedicated chat channel (e.g., Google Chat, Slack) for quick questions and updates.

Task Management: A simple task board (e.g., Trello, Jira, Asana) will be used to track tasks, assignees, priorities, and overall project progress.

This structured approach is designed to enable your team of three to work efficiently and in parallel, with clear responsibilities and well-defined interfaces, making your "vibe coding" journey a productive and enjoyable one!
